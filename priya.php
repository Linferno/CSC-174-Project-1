				<p>Hello! My name is Pooja Priya. I prefer to go by my last name Priya. I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in Digital Media Studies and Computer Science. I grew up in Patna, India. It is a big city located near the India-Nepal border. In the Indian education system, it is common for high school students to choose from either the sciences, humanities and business streams. My high school was very focused on the sciences and as a result, I took classes in physics, chemistry and biology. In high school, computer science used to be my favorite subject and so I chose that as my major when I got to college. After my first semester, I realized that the University of Rochester curriculum was a lot more flexible in terms of which classes I could take. I took a few music and design classes to explore my interests and realized that I really liked studying what makes good design, and I ended up adding Digital Media Studies as a second major.</p>

				<p>My interests include music, art, design and computer science. Initially, I wasnâ€™t sure how I might be able to combine that combination of interests, but I found that the field of mixed reality technology combined those aspects very neatly. It involved both the creative side and technical side of my interests. The environment is designed using principles of good design, and it also involves programming the software to make it work. It is a relatively new industry so there is a lot that is still being discovered and there is lots of research going on in this area, both in academia and the industry.</p>

				<p>Other interesting facts about me. Most people learn how to bike very young, but I did not learn how to ride a bike until freshman year of college. And then soon after learning how to ride a bike, I got my own bike and biked to Ontario Beach Park four times over the past summer. I like most forms of martial arts, and I participate in the karate and Tae kwon do clubs here at the university. Some other things I do for fun include singing, playing the guitar, making pencil sketches and watching movies.</p>

				<p>This past summer I was part of a field school in Ghana which focused on the surveying, reconstruction and structural analysis of Elmina castle and a few other forts along the coast of Ghana. I was able to learn how to use technology such as photogrammetry, which involves taking pictures of an object from multiple angles and then reconstructing it using software. The course also involved the use of technology such as laser scanning and 3D reconstruction. It was very educational for me and helped me narrow down what kind of career path I want to pursue. I am not entirely certain, but I would like to work in a research environment exploring how digital technologies for mixed reality can be combined with the humanities.</p>
