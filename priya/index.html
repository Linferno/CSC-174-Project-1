	<p>Hello! My name is Pooja Priya. I prefer to go by my last name Priya. I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in Digital Media Studies and Computer Science. I grew up in Patna, India. It is a big city located near the India-Nepal border. In the Indian education system, it is common for high school students to choose from either the sciences, humanities and business streams. My high school was very focused on the sciences and as a result, I took classes in physics, chemistry and biology. In high school, computer science used to be my favorite subject and so I chose that as my major when I got to college. After my first semester, I realized that the University of Rochester curriculum was a lot more flexible in terms of which classes I could take. I took a few music and design classes to explore my interests and realized that I really liked studying what makes good design, and I ended up adding Digital Media Studies as a second major.</p>
