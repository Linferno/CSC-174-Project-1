	<p>My interests include music, art, design and computer science. Initially, I wasnâ€™t sure how I might be able to combine that combination of interests, but I found that the field of mixed reality technology combined those aspects very neatly. It involved both the creative side and technical side of my interests. The environment is designed using principles of good design, and it also involves programming the software to make it work. It is a relatively new industry so there is a lot that is still being discovered and there is lots of research going on in this area, both in academia and the industry.</p>
