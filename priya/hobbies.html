	<p>Other interesting facts about me. Most people learn how to bike very young, but I did not learn how to ride a bike until freshman year of college. And then soon after learning how to ride a bike, I got my own bike and biked to Ontario Beach Park four times over the past summer. I like most forms of martial arts, and I participate in the karate and Tae kwon do clubs here at the university. Some other things I do for fun include singing, playing the guitar, making pencil sketches and watching movies. </p>
