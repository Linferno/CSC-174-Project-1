	<p>This past summer I was part of a field school in Ghana which focused on the surveying, reconstruction and structural analysis of Elmina castle and a few other forts along the coast of Ghana. I was able to learn how to use technology such as photogrammetry, which involves taking pictures of an object from multiple angles and then reconstructing it using software. The course also involved the use of technology such as laser scanning and 3D reconstruction. It was very educational for me and helped me narrow down what kind of career path I want to pursue. I am not entirely certain, but I would like to work in a research environment exploring how digital technologies for mixed reality can be combined with the humanities.</p>
