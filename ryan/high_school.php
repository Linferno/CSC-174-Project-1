    In high school, I gravitated toward math and science classes, taking the most advanced courses I could. I finished BC Calculus by junior year, and so took a linear algebra class in high school. I was similarly ambitious in the other subjects, taking all the AP’s I could, but wasn’t nearly as successful. History was a constant struggle to keep on top of dozens of dates and events which seemed so, so unimportant. English was also tough, as I could also not bring myself to see why studying Shakespeare would ever be relevant, but overall it was much more manageable. I wasn’t completely uncultured though, as my love for music kept me in school choirs, after school theater, and student run acapella organizations. Outside of school, I practiced piano and took voice lessons.
