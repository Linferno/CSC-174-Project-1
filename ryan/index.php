  <article>
    Hello, my name is Ryan Lin. I’m a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in mechanical engineering. I am also pursuing minors in computer science and music. I’m a singer and a pianist, taking voice lessons at Eastman School of Music. Both my parents emmigrated from Taiwan, and graduated from Eastman. They are now both successful musicians, raising me with a classical music upbringing. My father is a violinist in the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, and my mother is a piano teacher, choir conductor, and even taught the Texas Boys Choir.
