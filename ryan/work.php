  <article>
  My first real job was as a waiter, but I suspect not a single person reading this cares about that. I landed an internship summer after freshman year, at a civil engineering company called Lim & Associates. I did and learned a lot of civil engineering. I used the CAD program Microstation Powerdraft to draw up detailed maps of environments from data points provided from our company’s surveyors, used locator maps to make sure our proposed projects wouldn’t conflict with existing pipes and structures, and estimated costs of proposed projects in Excel from the materials we needed to buy. While interesting at times, I think my experience there taught me I’m much more inclined toward mechanical engineering instead.
