    I came into college with 23 credit hours. I took many more AP classes, but many of them didn’t count for classes. In addition, I took summer courses at Cornell, earning 7 credit hours in physics and engineering. While my mechanical engineering and computer science can be interesting and even exciting at times, it is relieving to balance out that analytical thinking with my more creative side in my music classes. I’m even taking advantage of the fact we have a wonderful and prestigious music school right next door, Eastman School of Music, and have an instructional voice teacher there. I don’t have any overlapping classes however, which means to graduate on time, I’m taking 19-20 credits every semester. I’m able to keep on top of it, however, because I don’t want to regret not taking advantage of these four years I’m allowed to solely pursue education. If taking five classes is the same price as four, there’s no excuse not to learn as much as possible.
