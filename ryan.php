    Hello, my name is Ryan Lin. I’m a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in mechanical engineering. I am also pursuing minors in computer science and music. I’m a singer and a pianist, taking voice lessons at Eastman School of Music. Both my parents emmigrated from Taiwan, and graduated from Eastman. They are now both successful musicians, raising me with a classical music upbringing. My father is a violinist in the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, and my mother is a piano teacher, choir conductor, and even taught the Texas Boys Choir.

    In high school, I gravitated toward math and science classes, taking the most advanced courses I could. I finished BC Calculus by junior year, and so took a linear algebra class in high school. I was similarly ambitious in the other subjects, taking all the AP’s I could, but wasn’t nearly as successful. History was a constant struggle to keep on top of dozens of dates and events which seemed so, so unimportant. English was also tough, as I could also not bring myself to see why studying Shakespeare would ever be relevant, but overall it was much more manageable. I wasn’t completely uncultured though, as my love for music kept me in school choirs, after school theater, and student run acapella organizations. Outside of school, I practiced piano and took voice lessons.

    My first real job was as a waiter, but I suspect not a single person reading this cares about that. I landed an internship summer after freshman year, at a civil engineering company called Lim & Associates. I did and learned a lot of civil engineering. I used the CAD program Microstation Powerdraft to draw up detailed maps of environments from data points provided from our company’s surveyors, used locator maps to make sure our proposed projects wouldn’t conflict with existing pipes and structures, and estimated costs of proposed projects in Excel from the materials we needed to buy. While interesting at times, I think my experience there taught me I’m much more inclined toward mechanical engineering instead.

    I came into college with 23 credit hours. I took many more AP classes, but many of them didn’t count for classes. In addition, I took summer courses at Cornell, earning 7 credit hours in physics and engineering. While my mechanical engineering and computer science can be interesting and even exciting at times, it is relieving to balance out that analytical thinking with my more creative side in my music classes. I’m even taking advantage of the fact we have a wonderful and prestigious music school right next door, Eastman School of Music, and have an instructional voice teacher there. I don’t have any overlapping classes however, which means to graduate on time, I’m taking 19-20 credits every semester. I’m able to keep on top of it, however, because I don’t want to regret not taking advantage of these four years I’m allowed to solely pursue education. If taking five classes is the same price as four, there’s no excuse not to learn as much as possible.
